# Templatize #

Basic templating code, similar to Mustache.js. It originally started as needing a very simplistic template library, hence creating my own version, before snowballing requirements basically made it almost the same functional capacity as Mustache.js. On the plus side, it's much lighter, the core code just a little over 100 lines. For a brief comparison versus Mustache, see the last section.

## How to Use ##

Import the source or minified javascript. If regular script import, uses name `Templatize`. There is only one function you need to know:

*Templatize*.**render**(*template, *bindings*[, *cleanup*]) : Renders template.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- |
| `template` | `String` | The template. |
| `bindings` | `Object` | The object literal of data-bindings. |
| `cleanup` | `Boolean` | Whether to cleanup unrendered markups. Defaults to false. |

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**Returns:** (String) The rendered template.

----------

&nbsp; 

## Variables ##

Parts related to templates to be encased in double curly braces, with dot notation to traverse nested structures. Example below where above the break is the template and below the data-bindings.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{name.first}} is {{age}} years old.
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  age: 46, 
  name: { first: "Bob" }
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Bob is 46 years old.
```

Generally avoid any data-binding names starting with an underscore (`_`) as some reserved values use the underscore prefix (e.g. `_display` and `_parent`).

### Escaping ###

Escaping is simply done by prefixing the key with a bang (`!`).

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{name.first}} is {{!age}} years old.
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  age: 46, 
  name: { first: "Bob" }
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Bob is {{age}} years old.
```

## Formatting ##

Formatting options are also available by suffixing the property name in the template code with a colon and format directive. For strings, accepted directives are 'upper', 'lower', and 'capitalize'. For numbers, Templatize uses the [d3-format library](https://github.com/d3/d3-format). See documentation there for various formatting options.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{name:capitalize}} sells burgers for {{price.burger:$.2f}}.
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  name: "bob", 
  price: { burger: 5 }
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Bob sells burgers for $5.00.
```

Formatting also works for [lists]{#lists} and [functions](#functions).

## Lists ##

Lists are marked with a `&`-prefix and can only take in an array. The output is grammatically formatted with appropriate use of commas and/or the 'and'-conjunction, as dictated by the length of the list. No other dynamic text or subsections should be nested within a list and values within the array should be strings or numbers only for best results.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{&name}} sells {{&sells}} with {{&with}}. 
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  name: ["Bob"], 
  sells: ["burgers", "sodas", "fries"], 
  with: ["his wife", "kids"]
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Bob sells burgers, sodas, and fries with his wife and kids.
```

&nbsp; 

## Sections ##

### Basic Sections ###

Section are marked with start at `#`-prefix and end at `/`-prefix. By binding section to a `true` or `false` value, they may be shown or removed.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{#married}}Is married.{{/married}}{{#single}}Is single.{{/single}}
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  married: true, 
  single: false
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Is married.
```

You may also do an inverse section by replacing `#` starting prefix with `^`. Such sections will only be displayed if the section is evaluated to `false`.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{^single}}Is not single.{{/single}}
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{single: false}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Is not single.
```

Data may be put inside of a section. E.g.:

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{#married}}Is married to {{spouse}}.{{/married}}
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  married: true, 
  spouse: "Linda"
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Is married to Linda.
```

If the section key does not exist, that section is simply not evaluated in the template, which is a common error. E.g.: 

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{#married}}Is married.{{/married}}{{#single}}Is single.{{/single}}
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{married: true}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Is married.{{#single}}Is single.{{/single}}
```

### Section value evaluation ###

Section data may be other values besides boolean. However, evaluation of non-boolean values have minor differences from normal Javascript behavior. Values of `undefined`, `null`, an empty string, or a string composed only of whitespace (if you want to add whitespace, use `&nbsp;`), evaluate to `false`. Conversely, a value of `0` is evaluated as `true`.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
Profit:<br />
Monday - {{#monday}}${{monday}}{{/monday}}{{^monday}}Closed{{/monday}}<br />
Sunday - {{#sunday}}${{sunday}}{{/sunday}}{{^sunday}}Closed{{/sunday}}<br />
Saturday - {{#saturday}}${{saturday}}{{/saturday}}{{^saturday}}Closed{{/saturday}}<br />
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  monday: null, 
  sunday: 0, 
  saturday: 122
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Profit:
Monday - Closed
Sunday - $0
Saturday - $122
```

### Sections with data ###

As long as data-binding for section evaluates to `true` ([see above](#section-value-evaluation)), it will be treated as such. You may use this as a shortcut for both displaying the section and formatting its value:

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{#job}}Occupation: {{job}}{{/job}}
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{job: "Chef"}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Occupation: Chef
```

The above though is somewhat messy of an implementation. One alternative is to separate a "display" variable like so:

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{#showJob}}Occupation: {{job}}{{/showJob}}
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  showJob: true, 
  job: "Chef"
}
```

Or, even better, used a nested structure for the section like below:

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{#job}}Occupation: {{job.title}}{/job}}
```
 
&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  job: {title: "Chef"}
}
// or conversely, which will hide the entire section..
{
  job: false
}
```

Note that section data (excluding repeating sections) are scoped for the entire template. E.g., given the above example, `{{job.title}}` may be used anywhere in the template inside or outside of a `{{#job}}{{/job}}` section and will be replaced with `"Chef"` when rendered.

### More section behavior ###

Section data may still be filled out but removed/hidden if a `_display` variable exists and evaluates to  `false` (this behavior evaluates "truthiness" in a standard fashion -- e.g. unlike for the section value itself, `0` evaluates to `false`).

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
Occupation: {{#job}}{{job.title}}{/job}} {{^job}}Unemployed{{/job}}<br />
Bob is a {{job.title}}
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  job: {
    title: "Chef", 
    _display: false
  }
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Occupation: 
Bob is a chef.
```

Note in the above that `_display` does not reverse the behavior of inverse sections (the section `{{^job}}Unemployed{/job}}` is still hidden as `job` itself is not evaluated to `false`). Also, nested section data may still be accessed and rendered outside of the section, even if the section itself is set not to display.

&nbsp;

## Repeating Sections ##

For repeating sections, set the section value to an array of objects and section html will be repeated. May still use `_display` to not use particular array item. Values within any array item are limited in scope only to that section given that array item.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{#children}}Child: {{children.firstName}}<br />{{/children}}
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  children: [
    {firstName: "Tina"}, 
    {firstName: "Gene"}, 
    {firstName: "Louise"}
  ]
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Child: Tina
Child: Gene
Child: Louise
```

Note value must be an array of objects. E.g., the above template with the following data-bindings will error:


&nbsp; *Data:*

```javascript
{
  children: ["Tina", "Gene", "Louise"]
}
```

However, the above case makes sense with [lists](#lists).

Unlike regular sections, repeating sections are limited in scope to its own section. Thus, variables within a repeating section's data bindings will not evaluate outside the portion of the template within the repeating section. Values from outside, however, can be scoped within the repeating section.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{#children}}Child: {{children.firstName}} {{lastName}}<br />{{/children}}
<br />
These won't evaluate: {{children}} {{children.firstName}} {{children[0].firstName}}
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  lastName: "Belcher", 
  children: [
    {firstName: "Tina"}, 
    {firstName: "Gene"}, 
    {firstName: "Louise"}
  ]
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Child: Tina Belcher
Child: Gene Belcher
Child: Louise Belcher

These won't evaluate: {{children}} {{children.firstName}} {{children[0].firstName}}
```

&nbsp; 

## Nested Sections ##

Nested sections should behave as expected, even mixing regular versus repeating sections, as long as you properly manage the scope.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{#children}}
  {{#children.lastChild}}and {{/children.lastChild}}
  {{children.name.first}} {{name.last}}
  {{^children.lastChild}}, {{/children.lastChild}}
{{/children}}
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  name: {
    first: "Bob", 
    last: "Belcher"
  }, 
  children: [
    {
      name: {first: "Tina"},
      lastChild: false
    }, 
    {
      name: {first: "Gene"},
      lastChild: false
    }, 
    {
      name: {first: "Louise"},
      lastChild: true
    }
  ]
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Tina Belcher, Gene Belcher, and Louise Belcher.
```

A few behaviors to note for the above example:

* Within the template for the repeating section, scope is still from the top level, hence we can render `name.last` within, and subvariables of `children` must be called via dot notation.
* `children[].lastChild` must be specified for all array items, as the evaluation for `lastChild` in each repeat of the section will only happen where such a key exists.

&nbsp; 

## Functions ##

Functions are evaluated to determine the returned value. The function is called within the context of the data-binding object where it resides.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{name}} has {{numChildrenText}}.
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  name: "Bob", 
  numChildrenText: function() {
    switch(this.children.length) {
      case 0:
        return "no children"
      case 1:
        return "one child"
      default:
        return this.children.length + " children"
    }
  }, 
  children: [
    {firstName: "Tina"}, 
    {firstName: "Gene"}, 
    {firstName: "Louise"}
  ]
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Bob has 3 children.
```

### Context and parent ###

In the previous example, the function `numChildrenText` was called with a `this` context of the data object at the same level in which the function exists, allowing it to access the var `children`. For nested, variables, `this` will also include a `_parent` to allow traversal up the data structure.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
The head of the family is {{head.name}}, who is married to {{relations.wife.name}}.
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  familyName: "Belcher", 
  head: {
    firstName: "Bob", 
    name: function() { return this.firstName + " " + this._parent.familyName }
  }, 
  relations: {
    wife: {
      firstName: "Linda", 
      name: function() { return this.firstName + " " + this._parent._parent.familyName }
    }
  }
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
The head of the family is Bob Belcher, who is married to Linda Belcher.
```

Note in the more deeply-nested case, `this._parent` is used twice to traverse upwards two levels.

### Nesting ###

Additionally, the return value of the function may also be another object, array, or function, and treated as appropriate.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
Bob's kids are {{&kidsNames}}<br />
Louise is {{kidsAges.Louise}} years old
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  children: [
    {name: "Tina", born: 2008}, 
    {name: "Gene", born: 2010}, 
    {name: "Louise", born: 2012}
  ], 
  kidsNames: function() {
    // this returns an array that we'll treat as a list
    return this.children.map(child => child.name);
  }, 
  kidsAges: function() {
    // this returns an object that we can nest into
    var ages = {};
    this.children.forEach(child => {
      ages[child.name] = 2021 - child.born;
    });
    return ages;
  }
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Bob's kids are Tina, Gene, and Louise
Louise is 9 years old
```

### Edge cases of function within functions ###

Finally, there is the special case of calling a function within a function. While this is easily done, all inner functions that are manually called require careful monitoring of the `this` context as it will not be automatically handled. You may at times need to explicitly set the `this` context (e.g. by using [*Function*.prototype.call()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call)). 

As well, `this._parent` will not be automatically created, if needed.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
The kids are {{&ages}} years old.
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  year: 2021, 
  calcAge: function(born) {
    return this.year - born;
  }, 
  children: [
    {
      name: "Tina", 
      born: 2008, 
      age: function() {
        return this._parent.calcAge(this.born);
      }
    }, 
    {
      name: "Gene", 
      born: 2010, 
      age: function() {
        return this._parent.calcAge(this.born);
      }
    }, 
    {
      name: "Louise", 
      born: 2012, 
      age: function() {
        return this._parent.calcAge(this.born);
      }
    }
  ], 
  ages: function() {
    return this.children.map(child => {
      child._parent = this;
      return child.age();
    });
  }
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
The kids are 13, 11, and 9 years old.
```

There's a lot going on here, so let's break it down step by step. First, we defined the function `calcAge`, which uses its `this` context to access `year`. Note that as it takes in an input parameter, it cannot be called directly by Templatize which can't know how to pass said parameter (using `{{calcAge}}` in the template would result in "NaN").

This function is called by the function `age` within each instance of `children`. In `age`, the `this` context is used to pass each child's `born` property as an input parameter to `calcAge`. Because the scope is nested, it uses `this._parent` to access `calcAge`. When `calcAge` is called here, because it is called from the scope of `_parent`, the `this` context within `calcAge` still has access to `this.year`.

Finally, the function `ages` maps each item in `children` to the result of the `age` function to create an array of just the ages. However, because we are manually calling a function within a function, and the inner function relies on `this._parent`, we need to supply `this._parent` as that variable is not automatically added in a manual function call.

Confused yet? Don't worry, the above case is a very contrived scenario to create a somewhat ridiculous but pronounced case for demonstration. There are many cleaner and more efficient solutions to the above example that avoid such scoping problems. E.g. the map function could simply return `this.year - child.born`.

### Error handling ###

By default, functions fail silently. If an error occurs during function call, exception is not raised further and value is assumed to be an empty string. To change this, simply set the `errorOnFuncFailure` flag to `true`: 

```javascript
Templatize.errorOnFuncFailure = true;
```

Depending on your dependency manager, this may or may not affect all references to `Templatize`. Generally speaking, assume `Templatize` is a static reference, so either adjust for all uses, and/or have it reset back to a desired behavior after using it with non-default behavior.

&nbsp; 

## Putting it all together ##

Below is a complex example using a bit of everything covered above.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{name.full}} has {{numChildrenText}}.<br />
{{&kidsNamesAndAges}}.
<br /><br />
{{#relations}}His {{relations.relation}} is {{relations.name}}. {{/relations}}
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  familyName: "Belcher", 
  name: {
    first: "Bob", 
    full: function() {
      return this.first + " " + this._parent.familyName;          
    }
  }, 
  children: [
    {name: "Tina", born: 2008}, 
    {name: "Gene", born: 2010}, 
    {name: "Louise", born: 2012}
  ],  
  numChildrenText: function() {
    switch(this.children.length) {
      case 0:
        return "no children"
      case 1:
        return "one child"
      default:
        return this.children.length + " children"
    }
  }, 
  year: 2021, 
  kidsNamesAndAges: function() {
    return this.children.map(child => {
      var fullname = child.name + " " + this.familyName, 
          age = this.year - child.born;
      return fullname + " is " + age + " years old";
    });
  }, 
  relations: [
    {
      relation: "wife", 
      name: function() { return "Linda " + this._parent.familyName; }
    }, 
    {
      relation: "rival", 
      name: "Jimmy Pesto"
    }
  ]
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Bob Belcher has 3 children. 
Tina Belcher is 13 years old, Gene Belcher is 11 years old, and Louise Belcher is 9 years old.

His wife is Linda Belcher. His rival is Jimmy Pesto.
```

&nbsp;

## Templatize vs Mustache ##

The support for grammatically formatted [lists](#lists) and escaping with `!` are unique to Templatize.

Minor syntactic differences are [evaluation of "truthiness"](#section-value-evaluation) (e.g. Mustache reads `0` as false when evaluating a section whereas Templatize treats 0 as a valid value), and scope within sections and when calling functions. Additionally, there is no inherent support for partials (though as Templatize maps and renders on runtime, a design pattern can easily work around this) and no support for custom delimiters.

### Caching ###

Mustache parses templates before rendering and maps all recognized markup locations. This introduces a bit of an overhead when first rendering a template and subsequently, Templatize is faster in that regard. However, the preprocessed map is cached in Mustache and all subsequent renders that use the same template are greatly improved in speed. If the same template is reused multiple times and speed is of the essence, Mustache may be a better choice.

### Missing Bindings ###

As aforementioned, templates are not preprocessed to map data-bindings. Instead, templates are rendered at call, using the supplied data bindings, and finding the appropriate, matching markup in the template. Consequently, **missing bindings in the template are rendered as is**. This may be particularly tricky when using inverse sections. The binding must still exist, even if it evaluates to `false` -- if undefined, the section syntax is ignored in the template.

Additionally, formatting issues are not checked and validated. Thus, providing an incomplete data-binding or badly formatted template will result in rendering issues.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{name.first}} {{#age}}is {{age}} years old.
```

&nbsp; *Data:*

```javascript
{age: 46}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
{{name.first}} {{#age}}is 46 years old.
```

In the above, `{{name.first}}` is not replaced because the binding does not exist in the supplied data. As well, the use of the `{{#age}}` section is erroneously rendered as the expected closing tag (`{{/age}}`) was not found.

To cleanup any remaining markup, set the `cleanup` parameter in `Templatize.render()` as `true`.
